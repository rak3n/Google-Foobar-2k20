My work for google foobar challenges

![alt text](https://github.com/rak3n/Google-Foobar-2k20/blob/master/assests/foobar.png)

It was really a fun and great learning experience

Note: It was really "mind-boggling + tough" and had to do some google searchs for most of the question (To get some idea for logic thinking), though challenges before level 3 where kind of easy .

Here is a quick run down all challenges for 5 levels of fun

* <b>Level 1:</b><br/> 
The Cake is Not A Lie

* <b>Level 2:</b><br/>
Gathering The Gears<br/>
Hey I Already Did That

* <b>Level 3:</b><br/>

* <b>Level 4:</b><br/>

* <b>Level 5:</b><br/>
